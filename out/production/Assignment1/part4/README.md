Brute forcing password with only lower case possibilities that is 6 characters long.

Password used: "trucks" 

I stopped the bruteforce after about a minute which it had reached up to "abbebb". With only 
lowercase letters and 6 characters long, there are 308,915,776 (26^6) different combinations. "abbebb"
is only 0.15% the way through the entire combinations and with the comination number of 477,283.
Its about 0.20% away from "trucks" which means it has about 29,339 minutes to go.
(Time for "trucks"=60Ã—(233,390,603/477,283))


Brute forcing password with lowercase and numbers

Password used: "7ruc1s"

Once 60 seconds had been reached I stopped the brute force and it had reached the combination
"aalfn6". With lowercase letters and numbers the total number of combinations are 2,176,782,336. 
This will take another 64 hours around about until we reach the password "7ruc1s". We are doing 8886 combinations
per second and there are 2,042,172,571 left till that password. (2,042,172,571/8886)/3600 = 64 hours.


Brute forcing password with lowercase and uppercase letters.

Password used: "TrUcKs"

After about 60 seconds we reached the combination "aadDOZ". there are 19,770,609,664 combinations.
This will take around 79 hours to reach the password "TrUcKs". With the same working as above.


So we can see having a mix of different characters and numbers can have a huge difference on 
how long it could take an attack to break into someone's account if they already knew their username.
